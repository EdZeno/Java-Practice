# Persistence

It is a simple code kata to practice JAVA

## What does it do?

The function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

Example: persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                             // and 4 has only one digit
